You are upgrading the Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind) into a **full professional brand system** using:

* Design tokens
* Color modes (light + dark)
* Arctic theme
* Scaling system (fluid spacing + typography)
* Component-level tokens
* Global motion system
* Tailwind theme extension
* True luxury-brand consistency

Do NOT change:

* Any business text
* Any layout structure
* Any branding decisions already made (logo, hero image)
* Any content or messaging

This is a **system-level upgrade**, not a redesign.

---

# STEP 1 — Create a Professional Design Token Architecture

Create a complete design token file (JSON or JS) for:

### Colors

* Primary Arctic Blue
* Aurora Green
* Midnight Navy
* Ice Grey
* Snow White

Each with:

* 50 / 100 / 200 / 300 / 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 / 800 / 900 scale

### Typography Tokens

* Font sizes (xs → 6xl)
* Line-heights
* Letter-spacing
* Font weights
* Fluid scaling using `clamp()`

### Spacing Tokens

* `space-1` to `space-20`
* Fluid spacing for responsive breakpoints

### Shadow Tokens

* shadow-sm
* shadow-md
* shadow-lg
* shadow-xl
* All based on Arctic “soft cold shadows”

### Radius Tokens

* sm / md / lg / xl / 2xl / full

### Motion Tokens

* Duration (fast/medium/slow)
* Easing curves
* Opacity transitions
* Transform transitions

Store everything in:
`client/src/design/tokens.ts`
(or equivalent)

---

# STEP 2 — Extend Tailwind Config with the Full Token Set

Modify `tailwind.config.ts` to:

* Map all colors to the new design tokens
* Map spacing to custom spacing tokens
* Add fluid typography scale
* Add custom animations from the motion system
* Add glass/frost utilities
* Add gradients using token colors
* Add dark mode using `class` strategy

---

# STEP 3 — Create Light Mode + Dark Mode Arctic Themes

Implement two themes:

### LIGHT MODE — “Arctic Day”

* White + soft blues
* Crisp clarity
* Cold shadows
* Frosted glass on navbar

### DARK MODE — “Arctic Night”

* Deep navy + emerald aurora accents
* High contrast but calm
* Subtle gradients
* Premium low-light UI

Automatic:

* Add theme switcher component
* Add theme persistence with localStorage
* Add smooth theme transition animation
* Respect user’s system preference

---

# STEP 4 — Build a Fluid Scaling System

All typography and spacing should scale smoothly across devices using `clamp()`.

Apply to:

* H1–H6
* Body text
* Button text
* Section spacing
* Card padding
* Navbar height

Goal: Frostline looks absolutely perfect on every screen size, from iPhone SE → 4K monitor.

---

# STEP 5 — Build Global Component-Level Tokens

Create system tokens for:

* Buttons
* Cards
* Panels
* Navigation
* Footer
* CTA components
* Service cards
* Hero section text

Make everything consistent:

* Same radius
* Same shadows
* Same spacing
* Same animation easing
* Same brand colors

---

# STEP 6 — Motion & Interaction System

Implement motion tokens into all interactions:

* Fade-up sections
* Slide-up cards
* Hover scale (very subtle)
* Button press animation
* Premium easing curves
* Crossfade theme transition
* Parallax-lite hero movement (VERY subtle)

All GPU-optimized.

---

# STEP 7 — Frosted Glass & Arctic Glow Utilities

Create utilities for:

* `frost-light` (barely noticeable)
* `frost-medium`
* `frost-strong`
* Aurora-gradient background helpers
* Glow-on-hover (tiny, luxury feel)

Make sure these utilities respect BOTH themes (light & dark).

---

# STEP 8 — System-Wide Consistency Pass

Apply the new design system to:

* Navbar
* Hero
* Buttons
* Cards
* Footer
* Contact section
* Pricing section
* CTA sections

No layout changes — only style harmonization.

---

# STEP 9 — Accessibility & Contrast Pass (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Ensure:

* Proper dark/light contrast
* All states visible in both themes
* Focus rings accessible
* Correct aria-labels

---

# STEP 10 — Return Full Results

Return:

1. All design token files
2. Tailwind config updates
3. Global CSS enhancements
4. Component modifications (only styling)
5. Summary of all work completed (Steps 1–10)
6. Do NOT add, remove, or rewrite any business text
7. Do NOT modify layout or page structure

This is a full brand identity & component system upgrade, not a redesign.

END OF PROMPT.
