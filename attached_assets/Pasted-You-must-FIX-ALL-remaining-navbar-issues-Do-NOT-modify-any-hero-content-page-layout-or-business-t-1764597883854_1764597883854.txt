You must FIX ALL remaining navbar issues.
Do NOT modify any hero content, page layout, or business text.

This is a **strict navbar hardening pass**.
Make the navbar 100% readable, aligned, stable, and premium.

Apply ALL changes below exactly:

---

# 1. NAVBAR BACKGROUND — MAKE IT 100% SOLID

The background is STILL bleeding the hero image through.
Fix this completely:

* Light mode: `bg-white` (no opacity)
* Dark mode: `bg-[#0e1a27]` (no opacity)
* Keep a VERY light `backdrop-blur-sm`, but it MUST NOT affect contrast.
* Remove ANY `[0.xx]` opacity modifiers.

The navbar must be fully solid, zero transparency.

---

# 2. TEXT COLOR — HARD-LOCK BOTH MODES

Current text disappears against hero.

Set:

* Light mode: `text-gray-900` (or token equivalent)
* Dark mode: `text-gray-100`

NO translucency, no opacity modifiers.

---

# 3. FIX OVERLAP — HARD-LOCK WIDTHS & GAPS

Some nav items still collide.

Apply:

* Theme toggle container width: **fixed 40px–48px**
* Language toggle container width: **fixed 40px–48px**
* Gap between nav items: **gap-4** (locked)
* Gap between right-group items: **gap-3**
* Prevent any item from shrinking: `flex-shrink-0`

---

# 4. ALIGNMENT — RESTORE PERFECT CENTER LAYOUT

Fix desktop alignment:

* Left group: Logo only
* Right group: Nav links + Language + Theme toggle
* Container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4`
* Main flex: `flex items-center justify-between`

Remove any:

* `ml-auto`
* `mr-auto`
* `justify-end` on child groups

Everything must align cleanly.

---

# 5. REDUCE NAVBAR HEIGHT AGAIN

It is still too tall.

Set:

* Py should be around: `py-2` for desktop
* Final total height target: **64px** hard target
* Mobile: keep compact but readable

---

# 6. MOBILE DROPDOWN — MAKE BACKGROUND 100% SOLID

Ensure:

* Mobile menu background is fully solid, no transparency.
* Text always readable.
* No hero-bleed.
* Proper spacing between menu items.

---

# 7. PREMIUM FEEL — KEEP ONLY SUBTLE EFFECTS

* Keep hover scale ≤ 1.03
* Transitions: `duration-150 ease-out`
* Keep shadow subtle: `shadow-[0_4px_20px_rgba(14,42,71,0.08)]`
* No heavy animations

---

# 8. NO BREAKING CHANGES

Do NOT touch:

* Hero
* Pricing
* Content
* Footer
* Theme system
* Tokens
* Page components outside navbar

---

# 9. RETURN

Return:

1. Updated Navbar.tsx
2. Updated ThemeToggle.tsx (if needed)
3. All Tailwind class changes
4. Before/After comparison
5. Clear summary of what was fixed

END OF PROMPT.
