You are updating ONLY the Contact page of the Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind).
Do not modify any other page or layout.
Follow all instructions below precisely.

⭐ 1. REPLACE THE CURRENT CONTACT PAGE DESIGN

Keep the current text content, but rebuild the layout into a premium Arctic-style contact page with these sections:

SECTION 1 — TOP BANNER

Create a minimal banner at the top:

Height: 220–260px

Background: subtle arctic mountain or aurora image with a soft dark gradient

Title centered:

Contact Frostline AS


Subtitle centered:

We respond quickly — every day.


Tailwind suggestion:

h-[240px] bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-white text-center 
backdrop-brightness-75


Use existing website image style (do NOT fetch new images unless needed — can reuse hero image with heavy blur).

SECTION 2 — CONTACT CARDS (3 CARDS)

Add a 3-column card layout (1-column on mobile):

Card 1 — Address

Icon: location pin
Title: Address
Text:

Kompaniveien 4
1639 Gamle Fredrikstad
Norway

Card 2 — Email

Icon: envelope
Title: Email
Clickable mailto link:

mailto:post@frostline.as?subject=Frostline%20AS%20Inquiry

Card 3 — Organization

Icon: building
Title: Company Details
Text:

Org.nr: 936 520 553
Transport company (passenger transport on demand)


Card style:

bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/20 rounded-2xl shadow-xl p-6 text-white
transition hover:scale-[1.02]

SECTION 3 — DIRECT CONTACT CTA BLOCK

Under the cards, add a centered block:

Title:

Need transport or want to discuss a partnership?


Subtitle:

Contact us today — we’ll get back to you quickly.


Buttons:

Send Email →

mailto:post@frostline.as?subject=Frostline%20AS%20Inquiry


Partner Inquiries → link to /partners

Buttons style:

bg-white text-black px-6 py-3 rounded-xl font-medium shadow hover:bg-gray-200 transition


And secondary button:

border border-white/40 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-xl hover:bg-white/10 transition

SECTION 4 — OPTIONAL MAP BLOCK

Add a simple placeholder card that looks like a map (no embedding required unless simple):

Title: Find Us

Block style:

w-full h-64 bg-gray-800/40 border border-white/20 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-xl shadow-inner
flex items-center justify-center text-white/70


Text inside:

Google Maps preview will be added here.

⭐ 2. PRESERVE EXISTING TEXT CONTENT

Keep all original contact page content textually, but place it inside the new sections where appropriate.

⭐ 3. FIX CONTACT LINK BEHAVIOR

Ensure that:

Contact (navbar) → /contact
Contact Us button (on homepage CTA) → /contact
Email links → mailto:post@frostline.as

DO NOT apply mailto to any other buttons.

⭐ 4. DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ELSE

Do NOT change:

Fonts

Colors

Navigation

Footer layout

Any other pages

Any services or hero content

Any OG-tags

Only redesign the Contact page visually + update link behavior as described.

⭐ 5. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return:

Updated React component for the Contact page

Any required Tailwind class updates

Updated link behavior

Fully integrated premium layout

No console logs, no placeholder lorem ipsum.
