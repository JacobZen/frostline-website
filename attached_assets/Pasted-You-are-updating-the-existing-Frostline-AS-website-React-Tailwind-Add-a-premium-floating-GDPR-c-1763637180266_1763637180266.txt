You are updating the existing Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind).
Add a premium floating GDPR cookie popup to the site.
Follow all instructions below precisely:

1. Create a floating popup component

Create a new React component named:

PremiumCookiePopup.jsx

Design requirements:

Floating card in the bottom-right corner

Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)

Soft shadow (shadow-xl)

Frosted glass / blur effect (backdrop-blur-xl)

Semi-transparent dark Arctic theme: bg-black/50

Light border: border border-white/20

Smooth fade/slide-in animation

Text inside the popup:

We use cookies to improve your experience, provide essential site functions, and understand how our site is used. By continuing, you accept our cookie policy.

2. Include buttons

Add two buttons:

Accept

Tailwind style suggestion:

bg-white text-black px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium shadow hover:bg-gray-200 transition

Privacy Policy

A subtle text button:

text-white/80 underline hover:text-white transition


This button should link to /privacy.

3. Popup behavior
LocalStorage logic

On load, check:
localStorage.getItem("cookiesAccepted")

If not accepted, show popup

When user clicks Accept, run:
localStorage.setItem("cookiesAccepted", "true")

After accepting → fade out and remove popup

Animations

Slide up + fade in on mount

Fade out on accept

Use Tailwind transitions where possible.

4. Positioning & responsiveness

Position:

fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50 max-w-sm


On mobile:

bottom-4 right-4 max-w-xs


Popup must not shift the layout.

5. Styling notes (must follow these)

Keep the “premium Arctic look”

Use blur + transparency

Rounded corners (large radius)

Soft shadows only

No bright colors

High-end luxury style

6. Code output

Deliver:

Full React component code (PremiumCookiePopup.jsx)

Import + usage in root layout or App.jsx so it loads on all pages

Tailwind classes already applied

LocalStorage logic working

Animations enabled

7. Do NOT modify anything else

Do not touch:

Fonts

Existing layout

Navbar

Hero section

Services section

Footer

Images or text

Only add the floating premium popup.
