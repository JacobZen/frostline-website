You are performing a **FULL PREMIUM APPLE-GRADE VISUAL REBRAND & MOTION SYSTEM PASS** on the Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind).

Do NOT change:

* Any text
* Any business content
* Any layout structure
* Any pricing
* Any branding decisions already made (logo, colors, hero image)

Only enhance:

* Visual identity
* Typography system
* Motion/animation system
* Spacing system
* Hover effects
* Responsiveness
* Shadows and gradients
* Overall luxury “Arctic premium” feeling

All improvements must remain subtle, fast, GPU-optimized, and production-safe.

---

# STEP 1 — Create a Premium Typography System (Apple-level)

Define a type system with perfect hierarchy and reading comfort.

Tasks:

* Set consistent font-sizes for all breakpoints
* Use fluid typography (`clamp()`) for titles and subtitles
* Improve letter-spacing and line-height for clarity
* Add consistent font weights (300–600)
* No radical changes — keep the same fonts and overall appearance

Goal: **Premium readability like Apple's site**, clean and calm.

---

# STEP 2 — Introduce a Global Arctic Motion System

Create a unified motion design language:

* Fade-up sections
* Soft staggered transitions
* Smooth, GPU-accelerated transforms
* Zero jank on iPhone SE and older Android
* Use `opacity`, `translateY`, `scale` only
* Short durations (150–280ms)
* Ease curves: `ease-out` or custom cubic-bezier (Apple-like)

Apply subtly to:

* Hero
* Buttons
* Cards
* Section entries
* Images

---

# STEP 3 — Add Ultra-Premium Hover Effects (Minimalistic)

Improve hover interactions for desktop users:

* Soft elevation (`shadow-[0_12px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]`)
* Smooth scale: `scale-[1.015]`
* Light background glow on cards (very subtle)
* Gentle frosting on hover for CTA buttons

Goal: **Luxury feel without any “gimmick”.**

---

# STEP 4 — Arctic Gradient & Color System Upgrade

Without changing color identity, improve consistency:

* Add subtle multi-stop gradients
* Refine Arctic blue tones
* Apply whisper-soft overlays for depth
* Ensure perfect contrast on small screens
* No neon colors, no oversaturation

Aesthetic target: **Northern lights softness + Apple clarity.**

---

# STEP 5 — Create a Global Spacing System (Consistent Rhythm)

Unify spacing across all components:

* Fix mismatched padding/margin
* Unify vertical rhythm (consistent 32/48/64px spacing)
* Ensure perfect proportional layout
* Optimize spacing for mobile and iPad

Outcome: cleaner, calmer, premium layout flow.

---

# STEP 6 — Arctic “Glass & Frost” Layers

Add extremely subtle glassmorphism:

* Light backdrop blur on navbar
* Optional frost overlays on cards
* Soft translucency on UI panels

Rules:

* Never reduce legibility
* No heavy blur
* Only thin, elegant Apple-style layers

---

# STEP 7 — Super-Premium Shadow System

Replace all shadows with a unified system:

* Ultra-soft ambient shadows
* No harsh black shadows
* 3-level shadow scale (Low, Medium, High elevation)
* Use rgba(0,0,0,0.06–0.18) ranges only

All shadows must feel **natural, cold, and diffused**.

---

# STEP 8 — Smooth Section Transitions & Scroll Behavior

Apply:

* Subtle parallax (very tiny)
* Smooth scroll
* Reduced jitter
* Gradual fade-ins
* Safe mobile performance

Ensure that each section flows like an iOS onboarding screen.

---

# STEP 9 — Advanced Responsive Polish (All Breakpoints)

Polish typography, spacing, and animations for:

* iPhone SE
* iPhone 11/12/13/14/15
* iPad Mini
* iPad Air
* iPad Pro
* Small Android
* Large Android
* Laptops
* 4K monitors

Fix any:

* Overflow
* Awkward wrapping
* Too-tight spacing
* XXL gaps

Goal: **pixel-perfect on every device.**

---

# STEP 10 — Final Arctic Identity Unification

Bring everything together:

* Consistent spacing
* Harmonized typography
* Unified animation language
* Elegant shadow system
* Balanced gradients
* Premium “ease-out” motion curves
* Clean cold-tone aesthetic

Do NOT alter:

* Copy
* Layout
* Branding
* Page structure

---

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return:

1. Summary of all enhancements (10 steps)
2. Only code blocks for files modified
3. No new sections added
4. No layout or content changes
5. No changes to business logic, text, or branding

This is a **pure premium Apple-grade polish pass**, not a redesign.

END OF PROMPT.
