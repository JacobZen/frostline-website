You are performing an elite-level Apple-style optimization pass on the Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind).
Do NOT change layout, text, business messaging, branding, or structure.
Focus ONLY on premium refinement, performance, micro-interactions, and visual polish.
All changes must be subtle, fast, stable, and production-safe.

STEP 1 — Lighthouse Target: 95+ on Mobile & Desktop

Bring the site to:

Performance: 95+

Accessibility: 95+

Best practices: 95+

SEO: 95+

Do this WITHOUT altering layout or copy.

If any score is below this, fix:

unused JS

uncompressed images

missing alt text

missing aria labels

missing metadata

render-blocking CSS

STEP 2 — GPU-Optimized Animations (Apple-style smoothness)

Upgrade animations to use GPU acceleration:

Use transform, opacity, translateY, scale

Avoid animating width, height, or top/left

Add easing curves (ease-out, ease-[custom]) for premium feeling

Ensure animations run smoothly at 60fps on iPhone 12 and lower

Apply to:

Hero fade-in

Section fade-up

CTA hover scale

Cards entering viewport

Animations should remain subtle.

STEP 3 — Smooth Scroll + Premium Motion System

Implement a global motion system:

Smooth scroll

Reduced jitter on section transitions

Slight parallax on hero background (VERY subtle)

Gentle fade for headers on scroll

Do NOT add heavy parallax or anything distracting.

STEP 4 — Advanced Responsive Pass (ALL breakpoints)

Polish every breakpoint:

360px (small Android)

390px (iPhone 12/13/14)

414px (iPhone Plus)

768px (iPad)

1024px (iPad Pro)

1280px (desktop)

1536px (large desktop)

Fix:

padding inconsistencies

CTA spacing

image scaling

any overflow

typography balance

STEP 5 — Arctic Glass & Frost Effects (subtle, modern)

Apply frosted glass effects using backdrop blur ONLY where appropriate:

Nav background (tiny blur, subtle transparency)

Contact cards or CTA panels (light frost look)

Footer top border (soft separation)

Keep everything extremely minimal and elegant — no heavy blur.

STEP 6 — Ultra-Clean Shadow & Layer System

Update shadow system to match Apple / premium Arctic UI:

Unified shadow tokens

Very soft, diffused shadows (shadow-[0_8px_30px_rgba(...)])

Remove any harsh or inconsistent shadows

STEP 7 — Loading Optimization + Instant Load Feel

Make the site feel instant:

Preload logo

Preload hero image

Add "anticipated paint" optimizations

Enable lazy loading for everything below hero

Use low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) if needed

Prioritize contentful paint improvements

STEP 8 — Codebase Refinement & Component Hardening

Remove unused CSS

Remove duplicate Tailwind classes

Combine repeated animations

Ensure consistent component patterns

Fix any console warnings

Fix any hydration mismatch issues

Do NOT change existing component names or folder structure.

STEP 9 — SEO & Metadata Upgrade (Advanced)

Add/refine:

Open Graph + Twitter metadata

Schema.org structured data (LocalBusiness, Product, FAQ)

Proper canonical URLs

Preconnect to analytics endpoints

Ensure this improves SEO without changing visible content.

STEP 10 — Final Premium Arctic Identity Pass

Unify the entire brand visually:

Consistent cold-toned gradients

Consistent Arctic blues

Harmonize all spacing

Smooth transitions between sections

Micro-interactions aligned with Frostline’s theme

Do NOT introduce new graphics or replace hero image.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return:

A full numbered list of changes for Steps 1–10

Any files updated (with code blocks only where actual changes occurred)

No changes to layout, text, pricing, business logic, or structure

No new components

No deletions of visible content

This is the most advanced polish pass.
All modifications must be subtle, high-performance, and stable on production.
