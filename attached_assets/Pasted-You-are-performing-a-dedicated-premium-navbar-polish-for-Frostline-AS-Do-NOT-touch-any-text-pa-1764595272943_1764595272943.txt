You are performing a **dedicated premium navbar polish** for Frostline AS.
Do NOT touch any text, page content, hero section, or layout structure.
Focus ONLY on the navbar and its dropdown/theme components.

This is a refinement pass on top of the brand system (Version 7).
Fix visibility, alignment, spacing, and premium feel.

# STEP 1 — Solid & Readable Arctic Navbar Background

Fix the background issues:

* Replace current transparent/frost background with a **solid 95–100% opaque Arctic background** in both light and dark mode.
* Keep a very subtle frost effect: `backdrop-blur-sm` (no heavy blur).
* The background must NOT let the hero image shine through.
* Ensure maximum text readability.

Use token colors, but increase contrast for menu items.

---

# STEP 2 — Correct Navbar Height & Padding

The navbar is too tall after the token update. Fix it:

* Reduce vertical padding by ~35–45%.
* Target desktop height: **64–72px max**.
* Ensure mobile height is compact and clean.
* Remove unintended padding from global spacing tokens.

---

# STEP 3 — Fix Alignment (Desktop & Mobile)

Correct the layout:

**Desktop:**

* Left: Logo
* Right: Menu links + Theme toggle + Mobile menu icon
* Ensure content is centered horizontally inside its container
* Remove unintended `justify-end`, `ml-auto`, or shifts to the right

**Mobile:**

* Ensure hamburger icon stays readable and aligned
* Prevent theme-toggle from shifting icons left/right

---

# STEP 4 — Fix Overlapping Elements

Resolve spacing/collision issues:

* Reduce spacing between nav items
* Set stable width for theme-toggle dropdown
* Ensure icons do not overlap at 100–125% zoom
* Remove unintended flex shrink/grow behavior

---

# STEP 5 — Improve Text & Icon Visibility

* Increase text contrast in both modes
* Ensure icons are not semi-transparent
* Ensure theme-toggle icon always stays readable
* Improve hover/focus states

---

# STEP 6 — Add Subtle Premium Interactions

Apply safe, elegant interactions:

* Soft scale on hover (`scale-105` max)
* Slight opacity fade-in for menu items
* Smooth easing: `ease-out` or Apple-like cubic curve
* 150–200ms transitions (not slow)

This should feel refined, not animated or flashy.

---

# STEP 7 — Arctic Shadow System for Navbar

Add a premium shadow:

* Use soft cold shadow token:
  `shadow-[0_8px_24px_rgba(0,0,0,0.12)]`
* Very subtle; no harsh edges
* Works in both themes

---

# STEP 8 — Mobile Menu Polish

Ensure:

* Mobile menu background is NOT transparent
* Text remains readable
* Proper spacing between menu items
* Smooth open/close animation
* No overflow / white gaps

---

# STEP 9 — Theme Toggle Polish

Fix the theme-toggle component:

* Align vertically with nav items
* Remove unintended margin/padding
* Ensure it doesn’t push content sideways
* Make icon crisp and readable
* Apply subtle hover effect

---

# STEP 10 — Return Clean Output

Return:

1. Updated Navbar.tsx
2. Updated ThemeToggle.tsx (if needed)
3. Updated CSS/Tailwind classes
4. Before/after code blocks
5. Clear summary of all fixes

Do NOT modify:

* Any business text
* Any layout structure
* Any hero content
* Any page sections outside navbar

END OF PROMPT.
