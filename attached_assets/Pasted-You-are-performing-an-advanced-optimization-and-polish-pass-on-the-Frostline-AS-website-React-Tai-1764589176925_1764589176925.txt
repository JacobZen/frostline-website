You are performing an advanced optimization and polish pass on the Frostline AS website (React + Tailwind).
Do not modify any business text, branding, messaging, or layout structure.
Focus only on performance, polish, animations, responsiveness, and premium feel.

STEP 1 — Advanced Image Optimization & Lazy Loading

Convert remaining images to WebP/AVIF where beneficial

Add loading="lazy" for all below-the-fold images

Preload hero image for faster above-the-fold render

Ensure correct responsive sizes (sm:, md:, lg:)

STEP 2 — Hero Section Premium Visual Upgrade

Without changing layout or text:

Add subtle fade-in animation on hero image

Add smooth text fade-up animation for title + tagline

Ensure animations do NOT hurt performance on older devices

Goal: Arctic premium like Apple/iOS landing pages.

STEP 3 — Mobile & Tablet Responsive Pass (Deep Scan)

Check ALL screen sizes:

iPhone SE

iPhone 12

iPhone 14/15

iPad mini

iPad Pro

Small Android

Large Android

Fix:

Any wrapping issues

Padding inconsistencies

Buttons too close or too spaced out

Overflows / hidden edges

STEP 4 — Section Transition Enhancement

Add extremely subtle section transitions:

Light fade

Slight parallax where appropriate

Reduce harsh breaks between hero → next sections

No layout changes, only smoothness.

STEP 5 — Navbar & Mobile Menu Polish

Improve mobile menu open/close animation

Make backdrop blur smoother

Ensure no scroll lock bugs

Perfect-center the Frostline logo vertically

STEP 6 — Footer Premium Pass

Do NOT change content.
Improve:

Vertical spacing

Padding

Link hover animations

Font weight balance

Make it feel “premium Arctic”, not plain utility.

STEP 7 — Add Subtle Global Micro-Animations

Examples:

Fade-in cards when scrolled into view

Soft hover effects

Smooth transitions on CTAs

Avoid heavy animations or performance hits.

STEP 8 — Improve Code Quality & Organization

Remove unused components + files

Remove commented-out code

Consolidate repeated Tailwind classes

Run final Prettier and ESLint passes

Improve consistency of component structure (if mismatched)

No functional changes.

STEP 9 — Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) Final Pass

Check all interactive elements for focus states

Ensure keyboard navigation is smooth

Add aria-labels where missing

Check contrast on buttons & hero text

STEP 10 — Final Arctic Identity Polish

Without changing images, text, or content:

Enhance gradients slightly to match Arctic tones

Improve background blur effects

Ensure shadows are consistent (Arctic soft shadows)

Make the overall experience feel colder, cleaner, more premium

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You MUST return:

A numbered summary of every change made (1–10)

Only code blocks for files that were modified

No changes to layout, content, pricing, or business text

No new sections or components

No removal of any existing structure
