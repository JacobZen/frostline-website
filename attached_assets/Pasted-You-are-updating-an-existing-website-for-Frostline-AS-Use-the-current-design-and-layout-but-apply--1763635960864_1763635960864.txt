You are updating an existing website for Frostline AS.
Use the current design and layout, but apply the following improvements exactly as described below.
The site is built with React + TailwindCSS (or keep the current stack unchanged).
Make the design modern, clean and premium.
The site already exists at https://frostline.as
 — modify it according to these instructions:

1. Improve the CTA buttons

Increase contrast on Book Now and Become a Partner buttons.

Make them slightly darker or add a white border on hover.

Keep size similar, just more visually clear.

2. Improve the language selector

Keep Norwegian (NO) and English (EN) flags/buttons.

Add subtle spacing between them.

Add a small active-language highlight (light underline or soft shadow).

3. Improve navigation menu spacing

Add 10–15px extra spacing between menu items (Home, Services, About Us, Partners, Contact).

Keep it clean and premium-looking.

4. Adjust the hero section

Add a soft dark gradient at the bottom of the hero image to make title text slightly clearer.

Do not change the image itself (northern lights over mountains).

5. Improve service icons

Ensure icons are equal size.

Add a subtle hover-lift animation (1–2px upward).

Optionally add a very soft shadow.

6. Add a short “About Frostline AS” teaser on the front page (under hero, above Services)

Insert this text block:

About Frostline AS
“Frostline AS is a certified passenger transport company operating in Tromsø and Eastern Norway. We provide reliable Arctic transfers for travelers and professional partners.”

Keep it in the same style as other section headers.

7. Footer improvement

Inside the Contact section of the footer, make this line more visible:

“We respond quickly.”

Place it under Available every day, slightly larger or with softer spacing so it doesn’t blend in too much.

8. Do NOT change existing content structure

Keep:

All links

All existing images

All service blocks

All pages (Home, Services, About, Partners, Contact)

Only apply the improvements listed above.

9. Code quality

Use responsive Tailwind classes.

Avoid overly bright colors; keep the Arctic/Northern Norway feel.

Keep design clean, minimalist and professional.

10. Output

Generate:

Updated React components / files

Updated Tailwind classes

Any necessary CSS refinements

Only code required to implement these improvements

No placeholder text except where specified

Preserve all existing texts unless specifically changed
